## 🧠 About the Project

**CarVal** is an AI-powered used car price estimator built for the Indian market. It uses a trained Gradient Boosting ML model to predict fair market value based on 13 car features — helping buyers avoid overpaying and sellers price competitively.

### Key Features
- 🎯 **90% R² accuracy** — cross-validated across 10 folds
- 📍 **11 Indian cities** — Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Chennai and more
- 🚗 **30 car brands** — 1,800+ models covered
- ⚡ **Auto-fill specs** — select a model and specs fill automatically
- 📊 **Market comparison** — shows real market low, average and high
- 📈 **Price meter** — visualizes where your car sits in the market
- 💰 **Dual currency** — prices in ₹ Lakhs + USD equivalent

## 📈 Model Training

The model was trained on a dataset of **6,019 real used car listings** from 11 Indian cities.

```python
model = make_pipeline(
    ColumnTransformer([
        ('ohe', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), cat_cols)
    ], remainder='passthrough'),
    GradientBoostingRegressor(
        n_estimators=500,
        max_depth=5,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        subsample=0.8,
        random_state=42
    )
)
# Cross-validated R² = 0.9008
```
